WHY ? To understand loops in depth.

STEPS TO FOLLOW WHILE SOLVING ANY PATTERN PROBLEM:

1. For the outer Loop , focus on the number of lines/rows
2. For the Inner Loop , focus on the number of columns and try to coonect them with lines.
3. Print inside the inner loop.
4. Obsever Symmetry (if there's any).

One more General Advice: Try to be as general as possible (loop shouldn't have hard coded values )
